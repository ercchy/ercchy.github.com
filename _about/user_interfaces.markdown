title: User Interfaces Planning
---
I am not a stranger to planning user interfaces for applications that I am building.
Working with client to get the information about essential parts of the
application and where their business is thriving. 
I also perform usability tests, as I think that end users are really most essential
 part of businesses that I build for.
