            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              <p>
                My name is Erika and I welcome you to my project page. 
              </p>
              <p>
                So I decided to put it together, because I am excited about projects and task that have fallen in my path and will come my way in the future. I know there will be many interesting ones, so I want to look down the memory lane some day and remember them all and how they helped me grown.
              </p>
              <p>
                My education path is somewhat out of the ordinary for an engineer. I actually started out as a student in a beauty school, training to be a hairdresser. However, as I never really wanted to become a hairdresser, I knew that my place was not in hairdressing salons. I did finish that beauty school with honors, but I never went on to practice the trade, as I did not feel “at home” with it. Some years did pass by and during those years, I was trying to find my “mission”. I tried working within many professions from sales to accounting (my mum was an accountant, so I thought it would make sense) and even drug rehabilitation centre as a person who had not had any drug related issues, thus I could help users to reintegrate into normal life.
              </p>
              <p> 
                All of the people that I have been working with, thought me among many other things, that it is important to know yourself, find what you like to do and go for it, no matter what. Therefore, I did! 
                However, before I would even think about enrolling at any university, I had to have much better foundation of knowledge than what beauty school gave me. Therefore, I did finish not one, but two more educational programs (sales and economics) in preparation for university even if back then I still did not exactly know what my studies would be. However, in the middle of first program I realized that computer science is my passion, even if back then I did not even know exactly what it is.
                I enrolled in the faculty of computer science in Ljubljana and graduated with honors, despite of everyone but my mum (she had thought me to take on “the impossible”) was trying to convince me that I would have never been able to make it. I guess they were trying to protect me, best way they knew how, so I never took it as a bad thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                From childhood on I was always sitting behind computer (whenever I could or my mum did not need it for her work) and fiddle with it for hours on end, but as a young girl I had never thought about working with computers as a profession, since it was considered a male domain. Looking back now I don't know how I or anyone else didn't see this possibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I love what I do and furthermore I am very excited about what lays ahead of me.
                Currently I work at a start-up, which is developing a cloud brokerage platform for a big telecom company and inspires to expand to foreign markets. As a s a software engineer I am blessed to work with amazingly smart people, who are sharing their gained knowledge and years of experience with me every day.
                We are working with Python programming language and are using Django as a web framework. Since my background was Java I was excited to learn new language, just to realize that it is actually not only super efficient but super fun as well. I did meet some of the community at my first Python conference at EuroPython 2012 in Florence, which inspired me to know more. I also regularly go to Django or Python meet ups in my town, but as we are a tiny country even community is tiny, but pleasant nevertheless.

                    <p>
                      It's built according to the requirements of a telecom company, which had recently entered cloud brokerage market. The goal is to provide SOHO and SMEs with commodity like cloud services. Application offers a cloud based ordering and managing of those services, thus providing easy access with online product like shopping cart. 
                      At the back end is made as a custom CMS, to provide easy managing of the front end. Templates are selected by the system according to the url that was requested. If template with the url's name exists than it is displayed otherwise generic template is displayed. With this feature, we enabled designers to work with easy to use templating system.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                          Social login as well as custom login forms. User profile is connected to Django's user.auth module and which is connected to the cloud services gateway. Social login is implemented with the third party component (janrain).

                        <li>
                          Price list is automatically generated from range of available services, that are stored in gateway DB. Services also include features that come in bundle with the service and the kind that are <span class="hiddenSpellError" pre="are " onclick="AtD.suggest(this);">orderable</span>.

                          Shopping cart includes order procedure which contains four steps. For better user experience we included jQuery into process for the purpose of calculating prices on the spot.

                        <li>
                          Revision of ordered services by clients was implemented in order to provide them with easy to use managing of number of subscriptions for particular service.

                      I was involved in the project from the start, as a developer and sometimes front end expert (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript). From implementing logic which presented shopping cart and processes that supported messaging system and many others, my task was also to keep the design responsive, which was also important since we provide access from anywhere, with any device.

                      This application was made when in order for the company, which just entered the cloud brokerage market, to enable staff to educate them selfs about the services they were now selling. Since they just entered the marked and had previously no experiences with selling cloud based services, they are able to follow a series of questions and get the answers that were imperative in order to figure out best possible solutions for them. This tool is simply taking user step by step through questions that were defined earlier by the providers of the services.

Project had few back end services that were written within Django framework, such as serving static pages, assembling data and pushing it to views. Everything else was made as a dynamic client side web application, built with jquery framework for javascript.
