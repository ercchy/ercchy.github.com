            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Erika and welcome to my project page. I decided to put it together, because I would like to add some amazing projects to the ones I already have and when the time goes by I want to remember what I have been working on in the past. 
              I mainly worked on the projects that I describe below, during my current employment at a startup which is providing services to "telco" companies in the field of cloud brokerage.
              I worked in team with very talented people and my thanks goes to them, that I stepped on the path of software development.
              Before I went to university, I gained a great collage of experiences with various professions I, that was exploring. But all of the professions I got to know had one thing in common: people working in them, were driven and passionate about what they did. Because of them I realized that I want nothing less than finding what I like to do and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I learned that due to the problem solving nature in me, software engineering is a great choice for me.
              My education years lasted a while, as I finished three different secondary schools, before I enrolled at faculty of computer science at university of Ljubljana.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I like educate myself with new trends and gain knowledge of the industry, I like to follow awesome stuff that people come up with constantly, especially open source projects, where I can play around as well. 
              Somewhat out of the ordinary (among other things) about me is that I do sports, but not as much as I would like to. Recently I took up bicycle riding and I found it is super fun because it is dynamic and fast (depends on how much one is pedaling, but never mind...).

It is built within Django 1.3 framework. Data migrations are managed with third party application ["south"](http://south.readthedocs.org/en/0.7.6/), which is performing schema changes on DB. Python three engine [mptt](https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt), was used to provide hierarchy to the services pages. For improving performance, we used [django_compressor](https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor)

                      It's built according to the requirements of a telecom company, which had recently entered cloud brokerage market. The goal is to provide SOHO and SMEs with commodity like cloud services. Application offers a cloud based ordering and managing of those services, thus providing easy access with online product like shopping cart. 
                      At the back end is made as a custom CMS, to provide easy managing of the front end. Templates are selected by the system according to the url that was requested. If template with the url's name exists than it is displayed otherwise generic template is displayed. With this feature, we enabled designers to work with easy to use templating system.

                      I was involved in the project from the start, as a developer and sometimes front end expert (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript). From implementing logic which presented shopping cart and processes that supported messaging system and many others, my task was also to keep the design responsive, which was also important since we provide access from anywhere, with any device.

                  Overview:
                  <p>
                    This is an internal application of which intention is to implement custom CRM which is used by the sales staff of a telecom company, which is offering cloud based subscriptions to services. Within application sales staff is enabled to take the client through a process of ordering to a subscription of a cloud based service. At the end a salesperson can print all the legal documents and quote in order for a client to sign it. Application also generates reports for management to have access to information of sales personnel's success, which is implemented with google charts javascript library. Within the application a salesperson is also able to lookup domain availability, since one of the offers is domain registration. Sales staff is also able to send quote directly to clients email address.

                <li>
                  Features:
                  <p>
                    Sales is able to store clients data in db, which is then linked to their account in order to easily calculate commissions. 
                    Quote editor is enabling sales to make taylormade quotes for their clients, ordering services.
                    Quotes that had been made are easily sent to the client directly from within application via email, where every email is seemingly sent from the salesperson address. We achieved this by using AWS SES and a boto library to connect addresses of the staff to AWS
                    Pricelist is providing them with easy access to the information which is usually needed quick
                    Media files are served from within the application, in order for sales to show or print them out and live them at the potential client to contemplate
                    From application management is able to see the success of the sales personnel on how much quotes have been made, sent to the clients and how many quotes had been realized.
                    We also built in a dynamic tool written with javascript using MVVM framework Knockout.js, which helps staff to calculate expenses of a compatible offers in order to show clients how much they can gain with the subscription with them
                    Domain availability check tool was incorporated in to application to enable staff to check for available domain names which client wishes on the spot. User don’t have to be computer savy in order to sell services.
                    Messaging system, which is implemented in order for the staff to talk to technical staff about a particular client and make notes about them.
                    Generating documents in PDF format enabled staff to put out quick quote, which could client turn into a contract on the spot if they wished

                    I was involved in this project from the beginning to the end (altho is still a work in progress, as any software that is alive). My responsibility was to implement features like dynamic UI for the domain availability, building price comparison tool, implementing connection to AWS SES, generation pricelist directly from db and implementing the messaging system.

                      This application was made when in order for the company, which just entered the cloud brokerage market, to enable staff to educate them selfs about the services they were now selling. Since they just entered the marked and had previously no experiences with selling cloud based services, they are able to follow a series of questions and get the answers that were imperative in order to figure out best possible solutions for them. This tool is simply taking user step by step through questions that were defined earlier by the providers of the services.

                      I undertook this project at the beginning of my employment with the company that is providing gateway for cloud services for the telecom companies. Project had few back end services that were written within Django framework, such as serving static pages, assembling data and pushing it to views. Everything else was made as a dynamic client side web application, built with jquery framework for javascript.
