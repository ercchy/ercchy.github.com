            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Erika and this is my project page. I decided to put one together, because I would like to add some amazing projects to the ones I already have here. 
              Existing projects came to life starting my student years (which I started fairly late). Before I went to university, I gained a great collage of experiences with various professions I was exploring. All professions I got to know had in common people working in them, that were driven by passion for them. I realized that it would be nice if I find my passion and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I learned that due to the problem solving nature in me, software engineering could be a great starting point. Now I love what I do
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I like educate myself with new trends and gain knowledge of the industry, I like to follow awesome stuff that people come up with constantly, especially open source projects. 
              Somewhat out of the ordinary (among other things) about me is that I do sports, but not as much as I would like to. Recently I took up bicycle riding and I found it is super fun because it is dynamic and fast (depends on how much one is pedaling, but nevermind...).

                  My role:
                  <p>
                    I was involved in the project from the start, as a developer and sometimes GUI expert. From implementing logic which presented shopping cart and processes that supported messaging system, my task was also to keep design response, since our client was telecom company. At times this task was not easy, bcs of tabular data which had to be presented in a price list of products/services.
